# Machine_Learning_Coursera_pythonversion
This repository is based on Coursera's course "<strong>Machine learning</strong>" by Prof. Andrew Ng from Stanford University (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). In this course, all codes for the exercises should be written in Octave or Matlab. In addition, some codes are partially provided in advance.

Here, I wrote all codes using Python 3 by myself. This repository can be regarded as my study notebook because I added some explanation and did additional analysis.  
** Note: Some equations cannot be read on Github. However, they are visible on jupyter notebook environment.
